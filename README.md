# LunchDiscordBot

LunchDiscordBot is a Discord bot created to fetch and post the daily and weekly lunch menus specifically for TPA Mortteli, the cafeteria at SASKY Tampereen palvelualan ammattiopisto. The bot automatically posts the daily menu every morning at 9 AM and allows users to fetch the menu on demand using slash commands. Additionally, it includes a sleep mode feature to disable menu posting during vacation periods.

## Features

- **Automatic Daily Menu Posting**: The bot automatically posts the daily lunch menu every morning at 9 AM. If the menu is not updated on the website, the bot will retry fetching and posting the menu up to 10 times with a 6-minute delay between attempts.
- **Weekly Menu Posting**: Allows users to fetch and post the entire week's lunch menu.
- **Sleep Mode**: Admins can enable or disable sleep mode to stop the bot from posting menus during vacations.
- **Slash Commands**:
  - `/lunch`: Fetches and posts the lunch menu for the current day.
  - `/weeklunch`: Fetches and posts the lunch menu for the entire week.
  - `/sleepmode`: Enables or disables sleep mode. Usage:
    - `/sleepmode enabled:true` - Enables sleep mode.
    - `/sleepmode enabled:false` - Disables sleep mode.
